Ctrl+F every "Path." and "Environment." for irrelevant paths
Need some way to update Device.MapList if we get to add new maps
When something from Settings changes, use .Save() and don't forget to change App.[property]
Save settings from textboxes in App.InjectToTextbox
resultsview scatter chart switch legend with buttons so it can be bound to command
DataOut and initStab("reportertab")
ExperimentVM systemcontrol switch needs buttons visibility implementation
ExperimentVM ChangeWellTableSize() has tube as case 1; implement in view

Questions:
what does InitSTab codes do? can I run it all at once?
calibration statistics -whatis it and where to put it
confirm ExperimentVM ordercontrol row =1 col =0 and corresponding MainCommand parameter

what does chart2.Series["CLTARGET"].Enabled mean? another chart displayed? ---> CalibrationVM CalibrationSelector()

when something actually runs, UPDATE:


in ExperimentVM instead of App.Device.ActWell use Table96Wells and Table384Wells in (btnRead_Click  legacy)   where welltype.empty => false (legacy)
