Ctrl+F every "Path." and "Environment." for irrelevant paths
Need some way to update Device.MapList if we get to add new maps
When something from Settings changes, use .Save() and don't forget to change App.[property]
Save settings from textboxes in App.InjectToTextbox()
ResultsView scatter chart switch legend with buttons so it can be bound to command

ComponentsView SamplingON button - change behaviour like GetPosition Toggle button. for language swapping
AlignmentVM LastCalibratedPosition no implementation in legacy; Auto Align - no Run button implementation, and for some reason turns off LED's

App.InjectToTextbox() needs cleanup after it is finished
If "." is inserted into texbox that is meant to be for INT, round down/ make some alert/<<< or don't accept the ".">>> do that after
  cleaning up the App.InjectToTextbox()

GetProperty still goes to textboxupdater and changes properties
SetProperty goes same way and double time sets UI parameters

Fix bug with select all button in WellSelectView

Display a tab related to work order execution where you touch a well
  and all that wells properties (read speed, sample volume, bead map, etc) are displayed,
  During execution, highlight well currently reading and currently aspirating, updating properties as wells are read

The commands that change the dropdown state are legacy from keeping parameters in the firmware, same goes for initStab
  Can remove that and use Settings

what does chart2.Series["CLTARGET"].Enabled mean? another chart displayed? ---> CalibrationVM CalibrationSelector()


PlateReport class has useless members except list

Subtract bed region background button. useless?

Switch language should account for selected settings in device. like for ChannelsVM

resultsVM has obscollections of obsobjects. can ez be translated to arrays[obsobjects], so obscollection not neeeded?


save template name somewhere, also display somewhere. fill it when template loaded.

TimerTick looks like not the best option. should be used only to update UI. program logic should be on a separate thread?

case "ClassificationTargetsContents": (CalibrationView Classification Targets)
  Save Calibration to current map button is viable?

Fixed a bug, also present in Legacy: second press of END button results in crash by SetReadingParamsForWell() accesing index+1
  State machine should not be active at all, if measurement is inactive

Fixed a TerminationReadyCheck() possible bug scenario, where assuming EndRegion = 1 could fuck up state machine

Device.TerminationReadyCheck() case 1
  looks wrong. don't copy EndRead button function here? why not?

select the text in a text box when a box is selected
  so that typing replaces the value. it adds now, a second select of the text box should bring up the curosr for editing

DataProcessor.BinMapData() could use some optimisation
ResultsVM.SetDisplayedMap() can be optimised

MicroCyDevice.IsNewWorkOrder() is crazy, since it is checked by app.TimerTick every tick. should be put on file watcher

active regions stats for well click

sampling button on ComponentsView could have an issue

make an Installer
mouse select doesn't work, from selected single well

trycatch on disconnect doen'st work

template select with finger problematic?

sort heatmap when inbetween wells - DONT!

for keyboard entry make existing text disappear

put outdir to settings? could be eh for usb sticks

  filters:                                done?
  1st one - don't save this bead record   done?
  2nd - still report it                   done?
  3rd postponed                           done?

ActiveRegionsStatsHandler could use a Span<T> instad of array allocation

!!!DataProcessor.BinMapData() could use arrays[,] instead of lists, for speed increase, and "sorting" would be done automatically!!! massive potential speed increase
sorting DisplayedMap is evil, since there is a high chancem that some other thread is working with it. even for backingMap

feature for double tap XY plot to magnify a region

WellResults cause a bunch of Multithreaded issues, I might look for another approach instead


--------------------------------------------------------

build a detail file that has info on all wells one file or 96/384 files
open another endpoint in usb?

calibration/validation

each map has it's own calibration
need info on which regions we are testing and input desired reporter value and desired Coefficient Variation
math: be in x% of true region center, desired Coefficient Variation

none/daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly

fill cal val map in methods which turn mode on
in end run event call checker if mode == such
