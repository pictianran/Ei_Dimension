Ctrl+F every "Path." and "Environment." for irrelevant paths
Need some way to update Device.MapList if we get to add new maps
When something from Settings changes, use .Save() and don't forget to change App.[property]
Save settings from textboxes in App.InjectToTextbox()
ResultsView scatter chart switch legend with buttons so it can be bound to command
DataOut and initStab("reportertab")
ExperimentVM systemcontrol switch needs buttons visibility implementation
ExperimentVM ChangeWellTableSize() has tube as case 1; implement in view
CalibrationVM Classification targets has a weird legacy chart2series stuff. propbably not necessary
ComponentsView SamplingON button - change behaviour like GetPosition Toggle button. for language swapping
AlignmentVM LastCalibratedPosition no implementation in legacy; Auto Align - no Run button implementation, and for some reason turns off LED's

Everything set to textboxes is expected to be inserted through numpad. if it is through regular keyboard, Device.Maincommand won't be executed. Fix it
  Implementations are in App.InjectToTextbox()

App.InjectToTextbox() needs cleanup after it is finished
If "." is inserted into texbox that is meant to be for INT, round down/ make some alert/<<< or don't accept the ".">>> do that after
  cleaning up the App.InjectToTextbox()


App.GetActiveMapIndex() might be too much, consider adding a field to Device


Display a tab related to work order execution where you touch a well
  and all that wells properties (read speed, sample volume, bead map, etc) are displayed,
  During execution, highlight well currently reading and currently aspirating, updating properties as wells are read


When finished - delete Program.cs and set startub object as App in properties

Questions:
calibration statistics -what is it and where to put it
confirm ExperimentVM ordercontrol row =1 col =0 and corresponding MainCommand parameter

what does chart2.Series["CLTARGET"].Enabled mean? another chart displayed? ---> CalibrationVM CalibrationSelector()

when something actually runs, UPDATE:


in ExperimentVM instead of App.Device.ActWell use Table96Wells and Table384Wells in (btnRead_Click  legacy)   where welltype.empty => false (legacy)

componentsVM LasersButtonClick() probably bug in multiple lasers on/off shoul be summed up?
