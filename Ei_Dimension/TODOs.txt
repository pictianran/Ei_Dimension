Ctrl+F every "Path." and "Environment." for irrelevant paths
Need some way to update Device.MapList if we get to add new maps
When something from Settings changes, use .Save() and don't forget to change App.[property]
Save settings from textboxes in App.InjectToTextbox()
ResultsView scatter chart switch legend with buttons so it can be bound to command

ExperimentVM ChangeWellTableSize() has tube as case 1; implement in view
CalibrationVM Classification targets has a weird legacy chart2series stuff. propbably not necessary
ComponentsView SamplingON button - change behaviour like GetPosition Toggle button. for language swapping
AlignmentVM LastCalibratedPosition no implementation in legacy; Auto Align - no Run button implementation, and for some reason turns off LED's

Everything set to textboxes is expected to be inserted through numpad. if it is through regular keyboard, Device.Maincommand won't be executed. Fix it
  Implementations are in App.InjectToTextbox()

App.InjectToTextbox() needs cleanup after it is finished
If "." is inserted into texbox that is meant to be for INT, round down/ make some alert/<<< or don't accept the ".">>> do that after
  cleaning up the App.InjectToTextbox()



BeadRegion class has a new member regionName. every map json has to implement that. do it for DimensionMaps file.
  Update on this: we'll actually use templates to keep regionName data.
  RegionsRenameHandler() is for remake with template.
  Added regionName field in BeadRegion struct is for deletion

App.GetActiveMapIndex() might be too much, consider adding a field to Device

Fix bug with select all button in WellSelectView

Display a tab related to work order execution where you touch a well
  and all that wells properties (read speed, sample volume, bead map, etc) are displayed,
  During execution, highlight well currently reading and currently aspirating, updating properties as wells are read

The commands that change the dropdown state are legacy from keeping parameters in the firmware, same goes for initStab;Can safely remove that and use Settings


When finished - delete Program.cs and set startub object as App in properties

Questions:

what does chart2.Series["CLTARGET"].Enabled mean? another chart displayed? ---> CalibrationVM CalibrationSelector()

when something actually runs, UPDATE:

ExperimentVM startButtonClick makes end buton red and disables read button. do the same?
ExperimentVM EndButtonClick has workorder not imlemented as well as button colors

PlateReport class has useless members except list

Subtract bed region background button. useless?
